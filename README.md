## Inspiration
  
  <p>What made me want to make a Pokémon game was because it was such a big part of my childhood. Waking up, opening my 3ds and playing, "Pokémon: Omega Ruby" was a core memory for me. That's why when I first heard that we had this much freedom into making our browser game, I immediately thought of making some sort of Pokémon game. Of course, making the full game is a bit much, so I went for something a bit more simpler, a Whack-A-Mole game.</p>
